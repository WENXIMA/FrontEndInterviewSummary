React:

-useEffect Method
    - useEffect(()=>{},[]). Render ONLY once after the inital render of the component.

-React re-render() when: 1. state update
                        2. props update
                        3.parent component has been re-render

-memo() => higher order component
    - React will skip rendering the component, re-use last rendered result
    -ONLY check props component


1. What is React Hooks?   What is the pros and cons? 
    -Ans: React Hook:
          React Hook allow developer hooked in React state and life cyle function.Such as useState,useEffect
          React Hook allow developer use state and other react features without writing Class
          Makes the related part in each component to smaller part

          Pros:
                -Easier to test and work with, easy to read.
                -Create re-usable component to avoid redunant logic
          Cons:
                -hooks do not allowed to mix old classes of component.
                -Do not have a way to attach reusable behavior to reusable state
2. What is useEffect, useState, useContext?
      - useEffect: 

JavaScript:
      Method:
        - sort() Method
        - Array.sort((a,b) => {a-b}) 
        - This method allow sort array as ascending order

    -forEach() Method
        - forEach similar to forLoop
        -Can not modify the sets in the object
        -forLoop can receive the index

    -concat() Method
        - Merge 2 array into 1 Array
        -Time complexity O(N)
    
    -splice() Method
        - splice(start,deleteCount,InsertItem);
        -months.splice(4, 1, 'May');
        - replaces 1 element at index 4
    
    GET vs POST:
        - POST are focus on CRUD function. GET is READ ONLY.
        - POST do not have restrict while passing the index from URL. GET do have limit
        - POST will not pre-load by browser unless manually set up. GET will pre-load by broswer.
    
    Set Method:
        - Set allow store UNIQUE of any types data(ONLY DATA).
        - Set.add -> add element to end of Set
        - Set.clear -> clear all element of this Set
        - Set.delete(value) -> Delete value from Set, Return boolean value.
        - Set.has() -> Return boolean value to check this value exists or not.



1. VAR vs LET vs CONST:
        - variable scope is different.
        - talk about your general rule on which to use in common cases. 
            (let are defined inside of function which this variable only called inside of function, const are usually store array object, not use var usually.)
        - VAR can be re-delcared and updated
        - LET is block scope, can be updated but NOT re-declared
        - const can not be updated or re-declared.
            -if const store object, even though we can not updated. but, we can update the attribute of the object.

2. Explain 'async' and 'await'
        - it allow us to write more eaiser method based on Promise async.
            - we do not need to call Promise.
        - Return Promise
        - I use promise to set up the firebase Auth Method
            - For example, when user want to sign out, then it will call the signOut Method.
               This signOut method is async function which it will await for firebase signOut(method) to be called,
               after firebase signOut has been called, this function will be execute
               
3. Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy
        - Deepy Clone means that all values of the variables are copied and disconnected from the original variable.
        - Shallow Copy means that certern values are still connected to the original variables. Create a new Object, Copy data types/store address. ONLY clone object space not resource


CSS:


1. What is CSS box model?
      - CSS box include margin, border, padding and content.
            -Total width = width + margin (left+right) + padding (left/right) + border(left/right)
      -box sizing attribute
            - content box: 
            - border-box: set height and width of element
            -inherit: inherit parent element box-sizing value

2. Implement a 2 Grid:
    - set a parent class and two box are inside of this div
    - set parent div display: flex
    - set height and width of two box and set second box flex:1
      

Webpack:

1. What is webSocket?
      - Implement two way communication between Client side and server side such as passing data.
      -pros: 
            - No same resouce limitation
            - Two way communication
      - cons:
            - more stable code in back end.
            - higher cost for maintance.
